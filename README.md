Climate change research has produced several important findings:

**Global Impacts and Trends:**

*   **Rising Temperatures:** The planet's average surface temperature has increased by approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) since the late 19th century, mainly due to increased carbon dioxide emissions and human activities.
*   **Ocean Warming:** The ocean is getting warmer.
*   **Melting Ice:** Ice sheets are shrinking, glaciers are retreating, and snow cover is decreasing.
*   **Sea Level Rise:** The global average sea level has risen by 8–9 inches (21–24 centimeters) since 1880, and the rate of rise has accelerated. Some communities could be at or below sea level by 2100.
*   **Extreme Events:** There's an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Asia is experiencing more extreme weather, alternating between droughts and floods.
*   **Ocean Acidification:** The acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution due to increased absorption of carbon dioxide. The ocean absorbs a significant amount of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions, between 20% and 30%.
*   **Carbon Dioxide Increase:** There is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than before the Industrial Revolution, about 50% more.

**Effects on Health and Well-being:**

*   **Health Threats:** People in every country face record-breaking threats to health and survival due to the rapidly changing climate, with many indicators tracking health threats reaching new records.
*   **Heat-Related Deaths:** A significant percentage (37%) of heat-related deaths are attributed to human-induced climate change. Heat-related deaths in people over 65 have risen by 70% in two decades.
*   **Maternal and Reproductive Health:** Climate change is increasing risks for pregnant women, unborn children, and infants, threatening progress in maternal and reproductive health.
*   **Food Security:** Climate change affects food availability, quality, and diversity, exacerbating food and nutrition crises.

**Vulnerable Populations:**

*   **Disproportionate Impact:** Although low-income countries and small island developing states contribute the least to global emissions, they suffer the harshest health impacts.
*   **Arctic Vulnerability:** The Arctic is warming at a rate twice as fast as the global average, with impacts felt worldwide, including the melting of ice sheets and glaciers that contribute to sea level rise.

**Concerning Trends and Predictions:**

*   **Irreversible Changes:** Some changes, like continued sea-level rise, are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.
*   **Dangerous Temperature Thresholds:** There's a concern about breaching dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points. Current pledges under the Paris Agreement could lead to a temperature rise of 2.5-2.9°C above pre-industrial levels, exceeding the 1.5°C limit needed to avoid the worst climate change impacts.
*   **Future Deaths:** It's projected that between 2030 and 2050, climate change will cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress alone.

**Mitigation and Adaptation:**

*   **Methane Reduction:** Methane levels are surging, and enforceable policies for emission reductions are essential.
*   **Air Pollution Reduction:** Reductions in air pollution have implications for mitigation and adaptation.
*   **Adaptation Strategies:** Adaptation strategies, such as heat action plans and early warning systems, are needed, especially for vulnerable regions.
*   **Ecosystem Resilience:** Supporting biocultural diversity can bolster the resilience of ecosystems like the Amazon against climate change.
*   **Managed Retreat:** Communities may need to adapt their infrastructure and strategically move away from the shoreline.
